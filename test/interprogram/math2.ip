(1) TITLE Math test 2 - Trigonometric functions

    # Classic INTERPROGRAM expresses angles to sin, cos, etc, in units of pi.
    # For example, 0.25 is 45 degrees, 1.0 is 180 degrees, etc.
    # Extended INTERPROGRAM has extra statements for degrees and radians.

    # sin(-0.25 pi) = -0.707106781...
    take -0.25
    form sine
    subtract -0.707106781
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # sin(45 degrees) = 0.707106781...
    take 45
    form sine degrees
    subtract 0.707106781
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # sin(2 radians) = 0.9092974268...
    take 2
    form sine radians
    subtract 0.9092974268
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # cos(-0.5 pi) = 0
    take -0.5
    form cosine
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # cos(130 degrees) = -0.64278760...
    take 130
    form cosine degrees
    subtract -0.64278760
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # cos(5 radians) = 0.283662185...
    take 5
    form cosine radians
    subtract 0.283662185
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # tan(-0.25 pi) = -1
    take -0.25
    form tangent
    subtract -1
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # tan(60 degrees) = 1.7320508...
    take 60
    form tangent degrees
    subtract 1.7320508
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # tan(0.5 radians) = 0.5463024898...
    take 0.5
    form tangent radians
    subtract 0.5463024898
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # atan(-1) in pi's = -0.25
    take -1
    form arctan
    subtract -0.25
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # atan(1.7320508) in degrees = 60
    take 1.7320508
    form arctan degrees
    subtract 60
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

    # atan(0.5463024898) = 0.5
    take 0.5463024898
    form arctan radians
    subtract 0.5
    form absolute
    if this is greater than 0.000001, go to FAIL

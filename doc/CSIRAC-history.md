CSIRAC History
==============

CSIRAC was constructed by a team led by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard,
running its first test program in 1949.  It saw almost continuous use at
the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney and then the University of Melbourne,
until it was shut down in 1964.

Technical specifications of CSIRAC:

* Clock speed of approximately 1000 instructions per second.
* 20-bit words which flowed through the machine using a 1-bit serial design.
* 768 words of mercury delay line memory for main "RAM".
* Up to 4096 words of magnetic drum memory for additional storage.
* Programs were entered on 12-hole paper tape.
* User data was input or output on 5-hole paper tape, or through the
  use of a 5-bit teleprinter.

Up until 1960, CSIRAC programs were written in machine code and punched onto
12-hole paper tape.  The invention of INTERPROGRAM allowed programs to be
written in a high-level programming language.

The user's programs were typed on a Flexowriter teletype, which also
punched the program onto 5-hole paper tape.  The program and any input data
was then fed into the CSIRAC running the INTERPROGRAM compiler/interpreter
environment.
